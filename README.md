# Anti-detect libs

For puppeteer:
[Secure-puppeteer](https://github.com/prescience-data/secure-puppeteer) - hides exposed API of Puppeteer, so it becomes undirected by CreepJS  
[Extra stealth](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/tree/master/packages/puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth) - trash, as easily detected by CreepJS

# Humanizing
